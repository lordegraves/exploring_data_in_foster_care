# Exploring Data in Foster Care

## Overview
This project explores foster care data to identify key trends and insights within the foster care system. It involves cleaning, preparing, and analyzing real-world datasets to draw meaningful conclusions about placements, time in care, demographics, and outcomes. The project was completed as part of a data analysis challenge.

## Files
- `foster_care_data.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing all data loading, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
- `Resources/` — Folder containing input datasets used for analysis.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Features
- Loading, cleaning, and preprocessing foster care datasets.
- Handling missing values and outlier detection.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and visualization libraries.
- Summarizing demographic trends and placement outcomes.
- Preparing datasets for further statistical modeling or reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lordegraves/exploring_data_in_foster_care.git
cd exploring_data_in_foster_care
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open the `foster_care_data.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load the foster care datasets.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Conduct exploratory analysis and visualize key metrics.
5. Use the resulting summaries and visualizations to gain insights into foster care demographics, placements, and time in care.
